## Project Description:


### Summary:
Rangers Rejoice! Our project is an Ecosystem Management program used by national park managers/rangers to keep track of the flora/fauna in their park. Rangers can log specific animals into the database, model their familial relationships, identify them + their traits, and track their health. Rangers can use this database to log plants, record park equipment, track habitat health, and more.
